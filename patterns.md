# Class patterns
Much of class is discussion-based, but we will have a few set patterns we'll be working with. The course schedule is enough of a three-ring-circus that not every class will proceed the same way. But I'll do my best.

## Roles
In addition to the patterns themselves, we have two specific roles that people will fall into and out of over the course of the term, Guides and Scribes.

* **Guides.** Guides ask the questions the other seminar members address themselves to. This can be a formal or an informal role. Every seminar member is expected to be both a formal and an informal guide (at least) once in the term. Formal guides should collaborate out of class to work on questions together.

* **Scribes.** Every discussion (formal or informal) will have at least one scribe. Scribes remain silent during the course of the discussion, instead documenting and summarizing the course of the discussion. This should not be verbatim, but synthetic. They will post what notes they take to the course Slack site. Every seminar member is expected to be a scribe at least once during the term.

## Patterns
The following are a menu of patterns that will be assembled to fill our four hours (or less!) together.

### Preamble
That said, each class will begin the same way:
* **Administrativia,** for as long as we need, and then
* **Good news.** _Not more than five minutes, and very possibly far less._ Seminar members will share good news from their lives. This is totally voluntary, and should not involve cross-talk.

### Formal guided discussion
Most weeks, we will begin with a formal guided discussion, in which one or two guides bring 2 or 3 questions in to organize discussion. Guided discussion proceeds as follows:
* **Guides present their questions.** _Not more than 5 minutes, and very possibly far less._ The guides will present their questions, and also offer motivations for those questions. Why are we turning to these questions and not others? These questions should follow the [Good questions](questions-and-discussions.md#good-questions) guidelines. These should indicate passages to read carefully together or moments in films & artworks to consider. It should also specify a question to orient the Think, pair, share activity that follows. This can be one of the two or three main questions, or it could be a smaller something to get the ball rolling.
* **Think, pair, share.** _5–10 minutes. Scott will administer this._ The protocol for Think, pair, share is very straightforward. First, _think_: spend a minute or two working on (or at least, near) the question, writing notes, finding passages from the reading, reading a particular passage. Then, _pair_: find a partner sitting in the seat beside you, and take turns saying what you thought about, for a set period of time. Each person gets a fixed period of time (30 seconds, a minute). Finally, _share_: report the findings back to the room at large. This reporting does not include cross-talk. Scott will begin this with the faintly maddening non-question, "I wonder what you talked about."
* **General discussion.** _30–40 minutes._ The transition from Think, pair, share into the general discussion is usually fairly organic. We will address ourselves collectively to the questions the guides brought in. The guides have no special role here, although they may wish to be vigilant about turning the room's attention to neglected questions (since, presumably, the questions mattered to the guides).

### Informally guided discussion
Most weeks, we will also have a second discussion that is redirected from the first, with different guides and scribes. The timing here will be more flexible, since this second discussion will itself have to take different amounts of time depending on other activities in a session.
* **Reflection.** _At most 5 minutes._ Reflection will begin by Scott asking the scribe(s) of the previous discussion to offer a brief, off-the-cuff summary. After that, everybody is welcome to contribute observations about the first discussion, offering reactions, observations, surprises, etc.
* **Posing new questions.** _A minute or less._ For about a minute, after the reflection, everybody will then reflect silently about what questions emerge from the first discussion: what was obscure? related but untapped? bewildering? curious-making? These will, of necessity, be vague, fuzzy, approximate, half-baked, etc.
* **New, informal guides.** _Brief._ Once that time is up, Scott will ask for one or two volunteers to be informal guides for the ensuing discussion. Informal guides will serve the exact same role: asking, and motivating questions. Each person will very briefly state their question and their motivation for it.
* **Honing new questions.** _At most 5 minutes._ We will have a brief discussion of each new question, working to shape it into something more pointed, sharper.
* **Think, pair, share,** followed by **General discussion,** as above.

### Scholar interview
Some weeks, Scott has scheduled a Skype visit with an author of the work we are reading. This will _not_ be the first activity in a class session. Instead, it will be preceded by a discussion, presumably emphasizing the work of that scholar.
* **Reflection,** and **Posing new questions,** as above.
* **Collection of questions.** _As briefly as possible._ Scott will then ask for volunteers to share questions, to work up a slate of interview questions for the scholar.
* **The interview.** _Not more than an hour._ Scott will moderate, but members whose questions are on the slate will in fact pose their own questions.

## Screenings
We will watch a bunch of material together in class. There are two different kinds:

### Future screening
For weeks in which we have screenings for the following week (indicated in the [course schedule](syllabus.md#course-schedule)), these will occur at the end of our time together. Scott will offer framing notes to organize your viewing at the beginning of the film(s).

### Current screening
For weeks in which we have shorter programs that are to be discussed in the seminar sessions in which they are presented, the screening will normally be the second activity. Scott will offer framing remarks. Afterwards, Scott will begin a general discussion with the faintly maddening non-question, "I wonder what you saw" (without crosstalk, as following a Think, pair, share, outlined above).
