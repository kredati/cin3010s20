# Class patterns
Much of class is discussion-based, but we will have a few set patterns we’ll be working with.

## Roles
In addition to the patterns themselves, we have two specific roles that people will fall into and out of over the course of the term, Guides and Scribes.

* **Guides.** Guides ask the questions the other seminar members address themselves to. This can be a _formal_ or an _informal_ role. Every seminar member is expected to be both a formal and an informal guide (at least) once in the term. In weeks when there are multiple formal guides, they should collaborate out of class to work on questions together.

* **Scribes.** Every discussion (formal or informal) will have at least one scribe. Scribes remain silent during the course of the discussion, instead documenting and summarizing the course of the discussion. This should not be verbatim, but synthetic. They will post what notes they take to the course Slack site, in the #minutes channel. Every seminar member is expected to be a scribe at least once during the term.

## Wednesday Patterns
Our Wednesday sessions, which constitute the formal seminar, will proceed as follows.

### Preamble
That said, each class will begin the same way:
* **Administrativia,** for as long as we need, and then
* **Good news.** _Not more than five minutes, and very possibly far less._ Seminar members will share good news from their lives. This is totally voluntary, and should not involve cross-talk.

### Formal guided discussion
We will begin with a formal guided discussion, in which one or two guides bring 2 or 3 questions in to organize discussion. Guided discussion proceeds as follows:
* **Guide(s) present their questions.** _Not more than 5 minutes, and very possibly far less._ The guide(s) will present their questions, and also offer motivations for those questions. Why are we turning to these questions and not others? These questions should follow the [Good questions](questions-and-discussions.md#good-questions) guidelines. These should indicate passages to read carefully together or moments in films & artworks to consider. It should also specify a question to orient the Think, pair, share activity that follows. This can be one of the two or three main questions, or it could be a smaller something to get the ball rolling.
* **Think, pair, share.** _5–10 minutes. Scott will administer this._ The protocol for Think, pair, share is very straightforward. First, _think_: spend a minute or two working on (or at least, near) the question, writing notes, finding passages from the reading, reading a particular passage. Then, _pair_: find a partner sitting in the seat beside you, and take turns saying what you thought about, for a set period of time. Each person gets a fixed period of time (30 seconds, a minute). Finally, _share_: report the findings back to the room at large. This reporting does not include cross-talk. Scott will begin this with the faintly maddening non-question, “I wonder what you talked about.”
* **General discussion.** _At least 30 minutes, and very possibly longer._ The transition from Think, pair, share into the general discussion is usually fairly organic. We will address ourselves collectively to the questions the guides brought in. The guides have no special role here, although they may wish to be vigilant about turning the room’s attention to neglected questions (since, presumably, the questions mattered to the guides). During the first 30 minutes of every general discussion, the rule is that Scott will remain silent unless asked a direct question by a member of the seminar. (He will take notes that he will post to Slack, and will also synthesize what he heard during the discussion.)

### Informally guided discussion
Some (possibly most or all) weeks, we will also have a second discussion that is redirected from the first, with different guides and scribes. The timing here will be more flexible, since this second discussion will itself have to take different amounts of time depending on other activities in a session.
* **Reflection.** _At most 5 minutes._ Reflection will begin by Scott asking the scribe(s) of the previous discussion to offer a brief, off-the-cuff summary of the conversation. After that, everybody is welcome to contribute observations about the first discussion, offering reactions, observations, surprises, etc.
* **Posing new questions.** _A minute or less._ For about a minute, after the reflection, everybody will then reflect silently about what questions emerge from the first discussion: what was obscure? related but untapped? bewildering? curious-making? These will, of necessity, be vague, fuzzy, approximate, half-baked, etc.
* **New, informal guide(s).** _Brief._ Once that time is up, Scott will ask for one or two volunteers to be informal guides for the ensuing discussion. Informal guides will serve the exact same role: asking, and motivating questions. Specific passages here are not necessary. Each person will very briefly state their question and their motivation for it.
* **Honing new questions.** _At most 5 minutes._ We will have a brief discussion of each new question, working to shape it into something more pointed, sharper. At this point, part of the work here may be to explore the readings together for relevant passages.
* **Think, pair, share,** followed by **General discussion,** as above, with Scott’s silence modulated for the balance of time.

### Scholar interview
Some weeks, Scott has scheduled a Skype visit with an author of the work we are reading. This will _not_ be the first activity in a class session. Instead, it will be preceded by a discussion, presumably emphasizing the work of that scholar.
* **Reflection,** and **Posing new questions,** as above.
* **Collection of questions.** _As briefly as possible._ Scott will then ask for volunteers to share questions, to work up a slate of interview questions for the scholar.
* **The interview.** _Not more than an hour._ Scott will moderate, but members whose questions are on the slate will in fact pose their own questions.

## Monday patterns
Mondays will (with one exception) involve encounters with aesthetic cases of various kinds. There will be no set patterns, as above, for Mondays. But you can count on a few things:
* In weeks when there are film screenings, those will come first. Scott will introduce the films.
* In weeks when there are no screenings, Scott will curate a set of a few artworks we will all encounter together. He will also introduce these.
* In all weeks, the work will be to discuss the works experientially and critically. One of the goals here will be to develop skills in describing and analyzing aesthetic works.
* After the screenings and/or communal encounters, Scott will orchestrate “research play time,” in which he brings in as many picture books as possible, and tells you to discover what interests you. The skills here will be about sharing and collaboration. At the end of “research play time,” members of the seminar will be invited to participate in “show and tell,” in which they present a _trouvaille_. There is no obligation to do so, although all students are very encouraged to share early and often.
