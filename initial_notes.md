### Description
Cybernetics arose in the post-WWII moment in the US as a meta-discipline, a general theory of systems, which could be used to model just about any phenomenon in the world (or the universe). The cybernetic project, on its own terms, aimed to allow scholars and planners to understand their domains at ever higher level of abstraction, safely ignoring the specific details. In the domain of artistic practice, systems thinking showed up in a variety of art practices that elaborated the operations of systems as their primary aesthetic medium. Artists like John Cage would seek in aleatory, iterative, and generative operations a refuge from art as expression. In this, and also in other terms, systems thinking offered an alternative to the canonically modernist concern with medium specificity. In short, art made under the influence of cybernetics may have been abstract, but it was not expressionist. This course offers an investigation of the ways cybernetics and systems thinking organized, both explicitly and implicitly, the engagements between art, aesthetics, technology, and the body in the experimental media practices in the forty years or so after WWII.

Put otherwise, this course offers a conceptual and historical approach to the relationship between aesthetics and technology in the long midcentury moment, organized by the opposing poles of cybernetic systems thinking and modernist concerns with medium specificity. The heart of the course will be a series of sustained engagements with experimental media art practices in a variety of mediaâ€”primarily, but not only, cinema, video, and computation. We will consider work by artists such as John Cage, Tony Conrad, Andy Warhol, Barbara Rubin, Nam June Paik, Yoko Ono, Alvin Lucier, Hans Haacke, Bruce Nauman, and others. The goal will be to put the work into conversation with a developing body of thought across the midcentury on the ways media technology intervenes in, modulates, and elaborates aesthetics in an expanded sense. Primary theoretical texts may include work by Norbert Weiner, Gregory Bateson, Maurice Merleau-Ponty, Gilbert Simondon, Stanley Cavell, Gene Youngblood, Seymour Papert, Annette Michelson, and Rosalind Krauss. Finally, our historian guides will include thinkers such as Katherine Hayles, Branden Joseph, Pamela Lee, Justus Nieland, Mark Hansen, Tung Hui-Hu and others. Students will pursue original research projects, culminating in a seminar paper.
